# PR Deploy Status Github Action
Github Action to fetch and output the PR's last deploy status to an environment. It is useful to developers to trigger a job only if the PR's last deployment to a PaaS was successful. 
Note: Validated this feature as part of Github - Heroku continuous deployment. Another important factor to remember, when a code pushed to a PR, the PaaS deployment is async. If this action is used in a PR, then there is a high probability that this check will never give the intended result. It is recommended to use this check in a `repository_dispatch` flow and trigger the job as part of the code deployment - post deploy process.
